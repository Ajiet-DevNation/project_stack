just as a heads up, next round you should use your critical thinking ;)

What is the boy now, who has lost his ball,
What, what is he to do? I saw it go
Merrily bouncing, down the street, and then
Merrily over — there it is in the water!

No use to say ‘O there are other balls’:
An ultimate shaking grief fixes the boy
As he stands rigid, trembling, staring down
All his young days into the harbour where
His ball went. I would not intrude on him;

A dime, another ball, is worthless. Now
He senses first responsibility
In a world of possessions. People will take
Balls, balls will be lost always, little boy.

And no one buys a ball back. Money is external.
He is learning, well behind his despair,
His first responsibility. He is learning to
stand up
Knowing he can’t always have what he wants.
